	<br>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<h3>IMPORTANT Terms to Remember in ths guide:</h3>
	<p>Affixing: The process of modifying, adding or removing augments.</p>
	<p>Augments: These are your "enchantments" or "modifiers." They help increase stats on weapons and units.</p>
	<p>Augmentation Aids: These are success boosters to help increase the chances during affixing. They are easily obtainable by trading Ex-cubes at the Ex-Cube swap shop on the 2nd floor of the shopping plaza.</p>
	<p>Augment Insurance (Max 4 Slots): A support item to prevent losing items upon failing an augment during affixing. Obtainable by swapping 10 Recycle-Badges for it at the Swap Shop.</p>
	<p>Base: This is the foundation of everything, and the unit/weapon that the augments will be affixed onto. This whole build will end up here.</p>
	<p>Fodder: Units or Weapons that contain augments to help affix your base.</p>
	<p>Recycle Badge: Equivalent to 1 AC Scratch Item. Bought from player shop or can be obtained by swapping AC Scratch Items at the Swap Shop.</p>
	<p>Slots: How many AUGMENTS a unit or weapon contains.</p>

	<h3>Step 1: Downslotting your base to 4 slots</h3>
	<p>In-depth Upslotting/Downslotting page <a href="guide.html#upslotting">here</a>. </p>
	<p>1. If your unit is at 4 slots already, go to Step 3. If your unit is 3 slots or fewer, go to Step 2. If your base unit is 5 slots or more, go grab a junk unit with the same amount or more slots as your base unit.</p>
	<p>2. Go to Dudu/Monica, and select "Affix Augment."</p>
	<p>3. First select your base unit, and then the junk unit.</p>
	<p>4. Click "Confirm" and if there is a pop up saying "You have a support item that certain Augments can be affixed to. Choose the one you wish to use," choose "Don't Use."</p>
	<p>5. Select the augments with the lowest success rates and click "Start Affix Augment."</p>
	<p>6. Now click "Yes," and unless you are very lucky at the wrong times, you can move on to Step 2. If your unit is still 5 slots or more, repeat 1-5</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Step 2: Upslotting your base to 4 slots</h3>
	<p>1. If your unit is at 4 slots already, go to Step 3. If your base unit is 3 slots or less, get 2 junk units with the same amount of slots or more as your unit.</p>
	<p>2. Go to Dudu/Monica, and select "Affix Augment."</p>
	<p>3. Now select your base unit first, and then select the 2 junk units.</p>
	<p>4. Click "Confirm" and if there is a pop up saying "You have a support item that certain Augments can be affixed to. Choose the one you wish to use," choose "Don't Use."</p>
	<p>5. Select the same amount of augments with an extra augment that has a HIGH chance of success to upslot your unit, and click "Start Affix Augment."</p>
	<p>6. Now under "Success Boosters" click the "Don't Use" dropdown and select the Success Booster (Augmentation Aid) you would like to use (I suggest using an Augmentation Aid +30%), and click "Yes" after you have done so.</p>
	<p>7. Now pray that everything succeeds if they are not all at 100% for success.</p>
	<p>8. Repeat 1-7 until your base unit is at 4 slots.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h3>Step 3: Affixing Eastern Soul onto your base unit</h3>
	<p>1. Take your base unit at 4 slots and (3x) Eastern Soul 4 slot units to Dudu/Monica</p>
	<p>2. Select "Affix Augment," first select your base unit, then the (3x) Eastern Soul 4 slot unit</p>
	<p>3. Click "Confirm" and if there is a pop up saying "You have a support item that certain Augments can be affixed to. Choose the one you wish to use." Choose "Don't Use."</p>
	<p>4. Select Eastern Soul, and 3 other augments that have at least 70% chance for success and click "Start Affix Augment."</p>
	<p>5. Now under "Success Boosters" click the "Don't Use" dropdown and select the Augmentation Aid +30%, and click "Yes" after you have done so.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h3>Step 4: Affixing Persona Reverie with Eastern Soul onto your base unit</h3>
	<p>1. Take your base unit with Eastern Soul at 4 slots, (1x) Persona Reverie with Historia Soul 4 slot unit and (2x) Persona Reverie Units 4 slot units to Dudu/Monica</p>
	<p>2. Select "Affix Augment," first select your base unit, then the (1x) Persona Reverie with Historia Soul 4 slot unit and (2x) Persona Reverie Units 4 slot units.</p>
	<p>3. Click "Confirm" and if there is a pop up saying "You have a support item that certain Augments can be affixed to. Choose the one you wish to use." Choose "Don't Use."</p>
	<p>4. Select Persona Reverie, Eastern Soul, and 2 other augments that have at least 70% chance for success and click "Start Affix Augment."</p>
	<p>5. Now under "Success Boosters" click the "Don't Use" dropdown and select the Augmentation Aid +30%, and click "Yes" after you have done so.</p>
	<p>6. Lock your base unit to prevent accidently using it as fodder.</p>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<h4>From here on, you might need to acquire more fodder for the augments below, but do not worry for the final product as when making the final product, if it fails you will not need to remake everything again because of Augment Insurance (Max 4 slots).</h4>
	
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>1. Take (1x) unit with Eastern Soul at 4 slots, (1x) Escarde Soul 4 slot unit, (1x) Deus Factor 4 slot unit, (1x) Yamato Factor 4 slot unit, and (1x) Mother Factor 4 slot unit to Dudu/Monica</p>

	<p>6. If any augments fail, acquire more of the fodder required, and repeat 1-5.</p>
	<p>7. If everything succeeds, lock the unit to prevent accidently using it as fodder.</p>

	<h3>Step 9: Making the final product</h3>
	<p>1. Unlock everything.</p>
	<p>2. Take your base unit at 4 slots with Persona Reverie and Eastern Soul and the following to Dudu/Monica. I have provided a handy checklist.</p>
	<p>-(1x) Aether Soul with Factor Catalyst 4 slot unit <input type="checkbox"></p>
	<p>-(1x) Factor Catalyst with Vol Soul 4 slot unit <input type="checkbox"></p>
	<p>-(2x) Factor Catalyst 4 slot unit <input type="checkbox"></p>
	<p>-(1x) Persona Reverie with Historia Soul 4 slot unit <input type="checkbox"></p>
	<p>-(1x) Augment (Melee & PP/3) <input type="checkbox"></p>
	<p>-(1x) Augment Insurance (Max 4 Slots) <input type="checkbox"></p>
	<p>-(1x) Augmentation Aid +40% <input type="checkbox"></p>
	<p>3. Select "Affix Augment," first select your base unit with Persona Reverie and Eastern Soul, then select the Aether Soul with Factor Catalyst 4 slot unit, Factor Catalyst with Vol Soul 4 slot unit, Factor Catalyst 4 slot unit, other Factor Catalyst 4 slot, and Persona Reverie with Historia Soul 4 slot unit.</p>

	<p>6. Enjoy your newly affixed 4 slot unit! BEST OF LUCK ARKS OPERATIVE!</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h3>Things to Think About</h3>
	<p>-Could you have used Elder Reverie instead of Persona Reverie for more defence at the cost of 20 less Ranged Power, 20 less Tech Power, and 2 less PP?</p>
	<p>-Maybe switch out Augment (Melee & PP/3) for Augment (Grand Might)?</p>
	<p>-Maybe use Acto Di Soul instead of Allies Di Soul for 10 more Melee attack at the cost of 10 less Range attack, 10 less Tech attack, and 35 less HP?</p>
	<p>-Maybe make the final product via upslot to save meseta on fodders?</p>
	<p>-If you cannot afford it, maybe farm for the fodder?</p>
